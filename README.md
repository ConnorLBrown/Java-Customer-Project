CIS 315 - Project 3
Project Objective: This project is designed to give the student practice in the
implementation of a program that demonstrates an understanding of classes and methods
in Java.
Problem Description: Use Java techniques to write an application program
for the following.
Lab Testing Application
A lab testing clinic needs an application to manage their customers and their payments.
*You can give an appropriate name for the clinic.
Your application must include the following.
➔ Ask the user the number of customers whose details needs to be added to the system.
➔ The user must then be prompted to enter the name and the department in which the lab
test will be carried out in.
The clinic consists of the following departments. Each department is identified by a number
followed by its name.
1. Microbiology
2. Virology
3. Hematology
4. Parasitology
Lab Testing Departments
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535358/
➔ A unique customer number is created by the application.
It is created by using the department number (1 – 4) followed by a 5-digit number.
Example:
Microbiology = 1
5-digit number = 10001
Unique customer number = 110001
*The 5-digit number can begin with a number of your choosing and will increment
automatically in the application, based on the number of customers.
➔ Each lab test costs $ 120.00.
➔ The customers should be able to view their balance and pay the amount owed.
➔ To see the status of the customer, we should be able to see their name, ID, lab tests, and
balance displayed by the application.
